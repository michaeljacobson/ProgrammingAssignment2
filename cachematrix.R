## The following is completes a programming submission for course R 
## propramming. Its goal is to expand two functions makeCacheMatrix 
## and cacheSolve that can be utilized to compute the inverse of a 
## square matrix x.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache 
## its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        s <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                s <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setInverse <- function(solve) s <<- solve
        getInverse <- function() s
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setInverse = setInverse,
             getInverse = getInverse)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already 
## been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the 
## cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        s <- x$getInverse()
        if(!is.null(s)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(s)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        s <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setInverse(s)
        s        
}
